    """Inverse transform that computes target bounding-box regression deltas
    given proposal boxes and ground-truth boxes. The weights argument should be
    a 4-tuple of multiplicative weights that are applied to the regression
    target.

    In older versions of this code (and in py-faster-rcnn), the weights were set
    such that the regression deltas would have unit standard deviation on the
    training dataset. Presently, rather than computing these statistics exactly,
    we use a fixed set of weights (10., 10., 5., 5.) by default. These are
    approximately the weights one would get from COCO using the previous unit
    stdev heuristic.
